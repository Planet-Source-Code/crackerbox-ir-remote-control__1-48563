### Description

This version only works reliably with olderstyle Panosonic or REC-80 remotes, and a PC with pentium 200 Mhz or better. VB does not interface well with the hardware directly. I will admit that VC will do a better job at what I am doing with VB. I have used the Receive line as it is more stable and I have figured out how to read the signals. I began with using a 850 MHz Celeron machine, it captured the IR signal well on the DCD line, however slower machines did not fair so well.

I first used Winlirc to decode the buttons of the remotes I am using, and compared them with a digital scope reading, and figured that the raw signal looked a lot similar to a signal being transmitted beteen 9600 and 14400 baud.
 
### More Info
 
For REC-80 Remotes it will return a button code, somewhat close to the way Winlirc does, however not in as much broken down detail.
